In addition to implementing the device code, answer the following questions:
1)  If you run the program like this:
   ./greyscalar -bw 16 -bh 16 file.ppm
   how many data elements are calculated by a single internal block? 


2)  If you run the program like this:
   ./greyscalar -bw 8 -bh 16 file.ppm
   how many data elements are calculated by a single internal block? 

Run the script dotests.sh.

3) In those experiments, which block size or sizes tend to give the best
performance?

4) In those experiments, which block size or sizes tend to give the worst
performance?

5) Why do you think the sizes you indicated in 3) provide better performance?
